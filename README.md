# Analog-Clock-Using-HTML-CSS-JS
This Analog Clock is a simple project that demonstrates the basic usage of HTML, CSS, and JS to create a functional clock. The clock displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds using analog hands that move in real-time.

To use this clock, simply open the "index.html" file in a web browser. The clock should automatically start running and display the current time.

The HTML file contains a basic structure for the clock, including a canvas element that will be used to draw the clock hands. The CSS file provides styling for the clock, including the size, color, and position. The JS file contains the logic for updating the clock hands based on the current time.

To customize the clock, you can modify the CSS file to change the appearance of the clock, such as the font size, color, and background. You can also modify the JS file to change the behavior of the clock, such as adjusting the speed of the clock hands or adding additional functionality.

Overall, this Analog Clock is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JS, or anyone looking to create their own custom clock. Have fun exploring and experimenting with this clock!
